# wildRtools

wildRtools exists as a dashboard currently hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://nathanwhitmore.github.io/wildRtools/). 

The purpose of wildRtools is act as hub so that people may access a suite of dashboards addressing a range of analytical issues useful for conservation. Some of these dashboards are highy generalisable (e.g. spatial visualisation) while others are highly specialised (e.g. tracking stream health via eDNA metrics). All the dashboards have a permissive MIT license attached to them and the code for them can be found on my GitHub repository.  

*Note: Some dashboards may be temporarily disabled prior to launch*
